			<h2>introduction</h2>
			<p> Hello everyone, my name is Andrew Neil and I am taking this class in my path to completion of my Computer Sceince degree.
			I am taking the Lewis and JJC 3+1 route and have completed all of my JJC courses so now I am a full time student at Lewis! I have 
			always really enjoyed working on computers and have recently fell in love with coding. I was first introduced to computers by my 
			father and grandfather back when I was around the age of 7. I always enjoyed fixing broken devices and built my first own PC in 6th 
			grade and since then have built many rigs for family memebers as well as helping out friends to build their own devices.</p>
